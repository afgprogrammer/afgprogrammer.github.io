It looks easy at first because PHP provides automatic type conversion. For example, you can assign an integer value to a variable, and the type of that variable will be an integer. On the next line, you can assign a string to the same variable, and the type will change to a string. Unfortunately, this automatic conversion can sometimes break your code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe most basic type of number in PHP is the integer. As you might already know, integers are numbers without any decimal part. For example, 2 is an integer, and so is 235298 or -235298. On the other hand, 2.0 and 3.58 are floats.",title:"Number Functions in PHP",date:"2021-02-10T00:00:00.000Z",image:"\u002Fimages\u002Fphp\u002Fnumber-functions-in-php.png",tags:["php","numbers-in-php"],instagram:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fp\u002FCLGigdfjO0C\u002F?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link",summery:"The most basic type of number in PHP is the integer.
