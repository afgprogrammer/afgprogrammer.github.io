It first evaluates an expression and then compares with the values of each case. If a case matches then the same case is executed. To use switch, we need to get familiar with two different keywords namely, break and default. The break statement is used to stop the automatic control flow into the next cases and exit from the switch case. The default statement contains the code that would execute if none of the cases match.
