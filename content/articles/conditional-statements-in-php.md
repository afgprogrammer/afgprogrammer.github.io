description: "Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.<br><br>

<b class='font-medium'>In PHP we have the following conditional statements:</b><br>
<ul class='list-inside list-disc'>
<li class='text-base'>if statement - executes some code if one condition is true</li>
<li class='text-base'>if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false</li>
<li class='text-base'>if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions</li>
</ul>

Ternary Operators

In addition to all this conditional statements, PHP provides a shorthand way of writing ifâ€¦else, called Ternary Operators. The statement uses a question mark (?) and a colon (:) and takes three operands: a condition to check, a result for TRUE and a result for FALSE.
