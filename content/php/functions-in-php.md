You already have seen many functions like `echo()` and `print_r()` etc. They are built-in functions but PHP gives you option to create your own functions as well.<br><br>

Its very easy to create your own PHP function. Suppose you want to create a PHP function which will simply write a simple message on your browser when you will call it. <br><br>

Following example creates a function called `sayHello()` and then calls it just after creating it."
