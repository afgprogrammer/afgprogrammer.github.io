description: "The real power of PHP comes from its functions.

- PHP has over 1000 built-in functions that can be called directly, from within a script, to perform a specific task.

PHP User Defined Functions:
Besides the built-in PHP functions, it is possible to create your own functions.

- A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.
- A function will not execute automatically when a page loads.
- A function will be executed by a call to the function.

PHP Function Arguments:
Information can be passed to functions through arguments. An argument is just like a variable.

Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma."
