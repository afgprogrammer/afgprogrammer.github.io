description: "A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.<br><br>

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.<br><br>

`preg_match()` Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not"
