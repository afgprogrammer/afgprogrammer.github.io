summery: "A string is series of characters, where a character is the same as a byte. This means that PHP only supports a 256-character set, and hence does not offer native Unicode support."
description: "A string is a sequence of characters, like \"Hello world!\". <br><br>For example, ‘P’ is a character and PHP is a string. <br><br>Everything inside quotes, single (‘ ‘) and double (” “) in PHP is treated as a string."
