<strong>What is PDO?</strong><br>
PDO refers to PHP Data Object, which is a PHP extension that defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing a database in PHP. It is a set of PHP extensions which provide a core PDO class and database-specific driver. Each database driver can expose database-specific features as a regular extension function that implements the PDO interface."
