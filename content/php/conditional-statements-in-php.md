<b class='font-medium'>In PHP we have the following conditional statements:</b><br>
<ul class='list-inside list-disc'>
<li class='text-base'>if statement - executes some code if one condition is true</li>
<li class='text-base'>if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false</li>
<li class='text-base'>if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions</li>
</ul>
