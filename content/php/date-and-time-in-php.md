You'll often want to work with dates and times when developing websites. For example, you might need to show the last modified date on a post or mention how long ago a reader wrote some comment. You might also have to show a countdown of the days until a special event.
<br><br>

Luckily, PHP comes with some built-in date and time functions which will help us do all that and much more quite easily."
