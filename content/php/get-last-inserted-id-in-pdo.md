<strong class='font-bold'>What is PDO?</strong><br>
PDO refers to PHP Data Object, which is a PHP extension that defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing a database in PHP. It is a set of PHP extensions which provide a core PDO class and database-specific driver. Each database driver can expose database-specific features as a regular extension function that implements the PDO interface.<br><br>
If we perform an INSERT or UPDATE on a table with an AUTO_INCREMENT field, we can get the ID of the last inserted/updated record immediately."
