description: "Working with numbers in PHP seems to be a trivial concept, but it can be quite confusing. It looks easy at first because PHP provides automatic type conversion. For example, you can assign an integer value to a variable, and the type of that variable will be an integer. On the next line, you can assign a string to the same variable, and the type will change to a string. Unfortunately, this automatic conversion can sometimes break your code.<br><br>

The most basic type of number in PHP is the integer. As you might already know, integers are numbers without any decimal part. For example, 2 is an integer, and so is 235298 or -235298. On the other hand, 2.0 and 3.58 are floats."
