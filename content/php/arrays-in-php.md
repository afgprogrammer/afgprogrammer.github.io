description: "There are basically three types of arrays in PHP:

Indexed or Numeric Arrays: An array with a numeric index where values are stored linearly.
Associative Arrays: An array with a string index where instead of linear storage, each value can be assigned a specific key.
Multidimensional Arrays: An array which contains single or multiple array within it and can be accessed via multiple indices."
