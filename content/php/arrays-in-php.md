<strong>There are basically three types of arrays in PHP:</strong><br><br>

<strong>Indexed or Numeric Arrays:</strong> An array with a numeric index where values are stored linearly.<br>
<strong>Associative Arrays:</strong> An array with a string index where instead of linear storage, each value can be assigned a specific key.<br>
<strong>Multidimensional Arrays:</strong> An array which contains single or multiple array within it and can be accessed via multiple indices."
